# fc-file

1. Write a program that asks the user for the name of a file. The program should display the contents of the file on the screen. If the file’s contents won’t fit on a single screen, the program should display 24 lines of output at a time and then pause. Each time the program pauses, it should wait for the user to type a key before the next 24 lines are displayed.
   
2. A program that processes an input file and produces an output file is called a filter. Write a program that asks the user for two filenames. The first file will be opened for input, and the second file will be opened for output. (It will be assumed that the first file contains sentences that end with a period.) The program will read the contents of the first file and change all the letters other than the first letter of sentences to lowercase. The first letter of sentences should be made uppercase. The revised contents should be stored in the second file.
